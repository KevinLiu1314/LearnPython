# Problem 303
# Multiples with small digits

# For a positive integer n, define f(n) as the least positive multiple of n that,
# written in base 10, uses only digits â‰¤ 2.

# Thus f(2)=2, f(3)=12, f(7)=21, f(42)=210, f(89)=1121222.

# Also, sum f(n)/n for n from 1 to 100 =11363107

# Find sum f(n)/n for n from 1 to 10000

# f(9) = 12222
# f(99) = 1122222222
# f(999) = 111222222222222
# f(9999) = 11112222222222222222
