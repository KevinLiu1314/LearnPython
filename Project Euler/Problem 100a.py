# Problem 100
# Arranged probability

# If a box contains twenty-one coloured discs, composed of fifteen blue discs
# and six red discs, and two discs were taken at random, it can be seen that the
# probability of taking two blue discs, P(BB) = (15/21)Ã—(14/20) = 1/2.

# The next such arrangement, for which there is exactly 50% chance of taking two
# blue discs at random, is a box containing eighty-five blue discs and
# thirty-five red discs.

# By finding the first arrangement to contain over 10^12 = 1,000,000,000,000
# discs in total, determine the number of blue discs that the box would contain.

# solve b/n * (b-1)/(n-1) = 1/2 for b in terms of n
# use the quadratic formula
