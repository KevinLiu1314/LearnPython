# Problem 131
# Prime cube partnership

# There are some prime values, p, for which there exists a positive integer, n,
# such that the expression n3 + n2p is a perfect cube.

# For example, when p = 19, 83 + 82Ã—19 = 123.

# What is perhaps most surprising is that for each prime with this property the
# value of n is unique, and there are only four such primes below one-hundred.

# How many primes below one million have this remarkable property?

# 1. n^3 + n^2*p = k^3
# 2. n^3(1+p/n) = k^3
# 3. n^3((n+p/n) = k^3
# 4. n * cuberoot((n+p)/n) = k
# 5. for k to be integer, n+p & n must also be perfect cube
# 6. let n=x^3 and n+p=y^3
# 7. p=y^3-x^3, so p is the difference of two cubes
# 8. p=y^3-x^3=(y-x)(y^2+xy+x^2), in order for p to be prime, y-x must be 1
# 9. so we are checking if the difference of two cubes is a prime number
